# The code you provided demonstrates the concept of multithreading using the `concurrent.futures` module in Python.
# This module provides a high-level interface for asynchronously executing functions in parallel. Let's break down
# the code and explain the concept:
#
# 1. Defining the Thread Function: - The `myfunc` function is defined, which takes a `name` parameter. This function
# represents the task that will be executed concurrently in multiple threads.
#
# 2. Main Program Execution:
#    - Inside the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block, the main program starts.
#    - The statement `print("maing begins")` indicates the beginning of the main program.
#
# 3. Creating a ThreadPoolExecutor: - The `ThreadPoolExecutor` class from the `concurrent.futures` module is used to
# create a thread pool executor. The `max_workers` parameter is set to 3, specifying the maximum number of threads
# that can run concurrently.
#
# 4. Submitting Tasks for Execution: - The `map()` method of the `ThreadPoolExecutor` is used to submit tasks for
# execution. It takes two arguments: the function to execute (`myfunc`) and an iterable (`['foo', 'bar',
# 'baz']`) containing the arguments to be passed to each invocation of the function. - The `map()` method schedules
# the function to be executed concurrently by multiple threads from the thread pool. It automatically distributes the
# tasks among the available threads.
#
# 5. Concurrent Execution: - As the `map()` method is called, the thread pool executor assigns the tasks to the
# available threads for execution. - Each thread executes the `myfunc` function with the corresponding argument from
# the iterable. - Since the tasks are running in separate threads, they can execute concurrently, potentially
# overlapping in time.
#
# 6. Thread Synchronization:
#    - The main program continues its execution even while the threads are running concurrently.
#    - However, the main program waits for the completion of all submitted tasks before proceeding further.
#    - The `with` statement ensures that the `ThreadPoolExecutor` is properly cleaned up after all tasks are finished.
#
# 7. Ending the Main Program:
#    - After all tasks have been executed, the main program resumes its execution.
#    - The statement `print("main ended")` indicates the end of the main program.
#
# In summary, this code demonstrates the concept of multithreading using the `concurrent.futures` module. By creating
# a thread pool executor and submitting tasks for execution, the code achieves concurrent execution of the `myfunc`
# function using multiple threads. The thread pool handles task distribution and execution, allowing for efficient
# utilization of available resources. The main program continues its execution after submitting the tasks but waits
# for their completion before proceeding further, ensuring synchronization with the concurrent execution.
