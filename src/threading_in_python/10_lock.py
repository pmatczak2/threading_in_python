import threading

# In the context of multithreading and parallel execution, a lock is a synchronization mechanism used to protect shared
# resources or critical sections of code. It ensures that only one thread can access the protected resource or execute
# the critical section at a time, preventing concurrent access and potential conflicts.
#
# A lock typically has two states: locked and unlocked. When a thread acquires a lock, it becomes the owner and enters
# the locked state, allowing it to access the protected resource or execute the critical section. Other threads
# attempting to acquire the same lock while it is locked will be blocked and put into a waiting state until the
# lock is released.
#
# The primary purpose of using locks is to prevent data races and maintain consistency in shared data. By acquiring a
# lock before accessing or modifying shared resources, threads can take turns executing the critical section, ensuring
# that no two threads access the resource simultaneously. This helps avoid race conditions, conflicts, and
# inconsistencies that can occur when multiple threads concurrently modify shared data.
#
# Locks can be implemented using various techniques, such as mutexes, semaphores, or condition variables, depending on
# the specific requirements and synchronization primitives provided by the programming language or library.

lock = threading.Lock()
print(lock)
lock.acquire()

#
# 1. `lock = threading.Lock()` creates a new `Lock` object and assigns it to the variable `lock`. The `Lock`
# class is provided by the `threading` module in Python's standard library.
#
# 2. `print(lock)` outputs the representation of the `lock` object. This representation typically includes information
# about the lock's state and identity.
#
# 3. `lock.acquire()` is used to acquire the lock. This method attempts to acquire the lock. If the lock is available,
# it is acquired, and the program continues execution. If the lock is already held by another thread, the calling thread
# will block (wait) until the lock becomes available.
# 0
# 4. `print(lock)` outputs the representation of the `lock` object after calling `lock.acquire()`. This will typically
# show information indicating that the lock has been acquired.
#
# 5. `lock.release()` is used to release the lock. This method releases the lock that was previously acquired.
# After releasing the lock, other threads waiting to acquire the lock can proceed.
#
# 6. `print(lock)` outputs the representation of the `lock` object after calling `lock.release()`. This will typically
# show information indicating that the lock has been released and is available for other threads to acquire.
#
# In summary, the code creates a `Lock` object, acquires the lock, releases the lock, and observes the changes in the
# lock's state by printing its representation before and after acquiring and releasing. The `Lock` object provides a
# synchronization mechanism that allows multiple threads to coordinate their access to shared resources and ensure
# data integrity.
